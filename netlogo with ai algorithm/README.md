# lab3-cs310f2018

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the starter files for Laboratory 3 assignment in Computer Science 310.

## Summary
This laboratory assignment invites you to work in teams to study and enhance
one of the community Netlogo models that demonstrate the usage of Bayesian inference.
Your enhancements to the selected model should benefit both the readability
and the interaction with the interface and the code for individuals interested
in learning about Bayesian inference. 
Finally, you are also responsible for writing a detailed reflection,
stored in the file `writing/reflection.md`. This is a Markdown file that must
adhere to the standards described in the [Markdown Syntax
Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Remember, you
can preview the contents of a committed Markdown file by clicking on the name
of the file in your GitHub repository.

Available for download at the course website [course
website](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/jjumadinova/teaching/310/labs.html),
the carefully formatted assignment sheet for this project provides more details
about the steps that a computer scientist should take to complete this
assignment.

## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub
Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features
that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the
