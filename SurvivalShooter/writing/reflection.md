3. what three things did you not like about the game?

First, it is easy to feel boring after I play for a while since there is only one scene.

Second, it is dull because we can not change guns when we are playing a shooting game.

Third, there are no game tasks that could include a interesting story..

4. Second part of lab.

I started with finite state machine representation and that give me a recall of general idea of this game. Then, I devise a MDP graph with an algorithm. I improved environment with its scenes and objects. In this lab, I have 2 problems. First, I designed a really good MDP model but My algorithm for that did not work well in unity. Second, I did not finish all of task four because I do not know how to collect that data of the number of total state transitions and the number of times each state was visited.
