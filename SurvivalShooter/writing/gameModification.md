1. Steps and challenges.

Firstly, I set up the environment and player. Secondly, I set up the enemies and the navigation for enemies. Thirdly, I set up the shooting ability for player and make it can kill enemies to get scores. The challenge is that my player was not able to turn with my mouse and I still cannot fix it. Since I am using new version of unity, the navigation setting are different. Therefore, my enemies do not attack my player.
