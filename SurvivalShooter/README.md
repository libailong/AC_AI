# lab5-cs310f2018

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the starter files for Laboratory 5 assignment in Computer Science 310.

## Summary
The first part of the laboratory assignment invites you learn how to develop a game in Unity and C#
by following a tutorial provided by Unity Technologies.
The second part of the assignment invites you to extend the game you develop in part 1
by applying a planning algorithm to your game character.

You are also responsible for writing a detailed reflection,
stored in the file `writing/reflection.md` and a game modification task sheet stored in the file `writing/gameModification.md`. These are Markdown files that must
adhere to the standards described in the [Markdown Syntax
Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Remember, you
can preview the contents of a committed Markdown file by clicking on the name
of the file in your GitHub repository.


Available for download under releases,
the carefully formatted assignment sheet for this part of the project provides more details
about the steps that you should take to complete this
assignment.

## Learning

To do well on this assignment, you should watch the provided tutorial and read Chapter 9 in the FCA book.

Also, please refer to the relevant [GitHub
Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features
that GitHub provides.

## Updating

To download the latest files for this lab assignment, you can type this command in the main directory for this repository:

```
git remote add download git@github.com:Allegheny-College-Science-310-F2018/lab5-cs310f2018.git
```

You should only need to type this command once; typing the command additional
times may yield an error message but will not negatively influence the state of
your repository. Now, you are ready to download the updates provided by the
course instructor by typing:

```
git pull download master
```

This second command can be run whenever the course instructor releases the second portion of this assignment with new material. However, please note that, if you
have edited the files that the course instructor updated, running the previous
command may lead to Git merge conflicts. If this happens, you may need to
manually resolve them with the help of the instructor.

## Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk
with  the course instructor during the laboratory
session. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Slack team for this
course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's
office hours.
